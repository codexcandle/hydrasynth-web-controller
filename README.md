# HYDRASYNTH WEB CONTROLLER

## overview
This idea started as I found it difficult to view the small LCD display of the Hydrasynth:
https://www.ashunsoundmachines.com/hydrasynth-key

Am starting with LARGE DISPLAY to choose device PATCH (PROGRAM + BANK).

## setup
1. setup via TEMPLATE:
  https://github.com/TheSwordBreaker/vite-reactts-eslint-prettier
  -yarn install
2. plugin your HYDRASYNTH to your computer (via usb).
3. start project:
  -yarn dev
4. view web page:
   http://localhost:3000/
5. using page controls, send midi commands to HYDRASYNTH.
