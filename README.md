# HYDRASYNTH WEB CONTROLLER

## overview
This idea started as I found it difficult to view the small LCD display of the Hydrasynth:
https://www.ashunsoundmachines.com/hydrasynth-key

Am starting with LARGE DISPLAY to choose device PATCH (PROGRAM + BANK).

Note, this project is based on the wonderful template:
https://github.com/TheSwordBreaker/vite-reactts-eslint-prettier

## setup
1. install project dependencies:
  ```yarn install```
2. plugin HYDRASYNTH to computer (via usb).
3. start project:
  ``yarn dev
4. view web page:
   http://localhost:3000/
5. using page controls, send midi commands to HYDRASYNTH.
